# ♻️ AI-powered Waste Segregation

An end-to-end, AI-driven waste segregation system combining deep learning with physical sorting mechanisms. This project utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet model to classify waste in real time and directs servo-controlled flaps to sort the waste accordingly. Ideal for smart bins, recycling centers, research, and educational purposes.

## 🧠 Overview

This project leverages computer vision and hardware control to automate waste segregation. It consists of three core modules:

1. **Model Training & Fine-Tuning**  
   A ResNet-based CNN is trained to classify waste into *organic*, *recyclable*, and *non-recyclable* categories.
   
2. **Real-Time Classification**  
   The trained model is integrated with a webcam to perform live predictions.

3. **Physical Sorting**  
   Based on predictions, servo motors actuate flaps to route waste into designated bins.
